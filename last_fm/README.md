# last_fm

The LastFM mobile client with Flutter.

## Intro

This project is functionally the same as the [LastFM mobile client with React Native](https://github.com/brascene/Last.fm-Client). The only reason for making it is to try out the Flutter and implement the same things (with small modifications).

UI goals: 

1. List of countries with search bar (screen_1)
2. List of top tracks for selected country (screen_2)
3. Track details screen (screen_3)

Functional goals:

1. Log in to your LastFM profile
2. Love track functionality
